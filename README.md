## üìù Assignment Questions  

### **Question 1**  
What is Simple Linear Regression?  

---

### **Question 2**  
What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?  

---

### **Question 3**  
What is heteroscedasticity, and why is it important to address in regression models?  

---

### **Question 4**  
What is Multiple Linear Regression?  

---

### **Question 5**  
What is polynomial regression, and how does it differ from linear regression?  

---

### **Question 6**  
Implement a Python program to fit a **Simple Linear Regression** model to the following data:  

- `X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
- `Y = [2.1, 4.3, 6.1, 7.9, 10.2]`  

Plot the regression line over the data points.  

---

### **Question 7**  
Fit a **Multiple Linear Regression** model on this sample data:  

- `Area = [1200, 1500, 1800, 2000]`  
- `Rooms = [2, 3, 3, 4]`  
- `Price = [250000, 300000, 320000, 370000]`  

Check for multicollinearity using **VIF** and report the results.  

---

### **Question 8**  
Implement **Polynomial Regression** on the following data:  

- `X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
- `Y = [2.2, 4.8, 7.5, 11.2, 14.7]`  

Fit a **2nd-degree polynomial** and plot the resulting curve.  

---

### **Question 9**  
Create a **residuals plot** for a regression model trained on this data:  

- `X = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`  
- `Y = [15, 35, 40, 50, 65]`  

Assess heteroscedasticity by examining the spread of residuals.  

---

### **Question 10**  
Imagine you are a data scientist working for a real estate company. You need to predict house prices using features like **area, number of rooms, and location**.  

However, you detect **heteroscedasticity** and **multicollinearity** in your regression model. Explain the steps you would take to address these issues and ensure a robust model.
